    "Machine learning(ML) is a way of teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed step by strep. Instead of telling the computers exactlywe what to do, we give it data and it learns patterns on its own. In machine learning, different types are there, Supervised learning which learns using labelled data, unsupervised learning which learns patterns without labelled data and reinforcement learning which works on trial and error, where agent learns from the real world experience.
